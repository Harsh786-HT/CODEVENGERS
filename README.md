# 🌿 CarbonIQ -- AI-Powered Industrial Carbon Intelligence Platform

> Decentralized AI Carbon Risk, Forecasting & Optimization Engine for
> Small and Mid-Scale Industries



## 🚀 Overview

CarbonIQ is a multi-layer AI-driven carbon intelligence platform
designed to help industries monitor, predict, and optimize their carbon
emissions using indirect operational signals.

Instead of relying on expensive CO₂ sensors, CarbonIQ estimates
emissions through:

-   🔋 Energy Consumption Patterns\
-   🌡 Thermal Load Indicators\
-   🔊 Acoustic Load Proxies\
-   ⚙ Operational Efficiency Metrics

The platform combines supervised learning, unsupervised anomaly
detection, predictive forecasting, and optimization intelligence into
one integrated dashboard.



## 🎯 Problem Statement

Small and mid-scale industries face:

-   Lack of real-time carbon monitoring\
-   Rising energy costs\
-   Increasing ESG compliance pressure\
-   No access to affordable carbon intelligence systems\
-   Difficulty in monetizing carbon reductions

CarbonIQ solves this by delivering AI-powered carbon intelligence
without requiring expensive infrastructure.



## 🧠 AI Architecture

### 1️⃣ Supervised Learning

Random Forest Regression model trained to estimate CO₂ emissions.

### 2️⃣ Unsupervised Learning

Isolation Forest for anomaly detection in operational patterns.

### 3️⃣ Carbon Risk Classification
